    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat

      then cooked by boiling or baking.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>0.25 cup olive oil</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>

      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic
        until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add eggplant; cook, stirring constantly,
        until eggplant is softened, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and juice;

        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in
        the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm
        to the bite, about 13 minutes. Drain and transfer to a serving bowl.
